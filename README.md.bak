# Comparisons

Naming convention of the different configurations:

- TC: Tail calling interpreter
- PGO: Profile-guided-optimization
- Ex: Experimental pre-release of MSVC that supports TC (musttail and preserve_none).  NoEx is the upstream released MSVC version 19.43.34808

"NoTC-PGO-NoEx" represents the configuration currently used to make Python releases.

"TC-NoPGO-Ex" represents the aspirational build with tail calling, but the experimental compiler doesn't currently support PGO so is currently sub-optimal.

There does seem to be a small regression of 4% on NoTC builds (a) when using the experimental compiler.  Perhaps this is similar to what we saw in clang-19.

All other things being equal, the effect of moving to the tail-calling interpreter is 44% (b).

Unfortunately, the effect of PGO on a NoTC build is 37% (c), which counts considerably against the overall wins of the tail-calling interpreter, netting only 1% (d).

It still seems plausible that if we can get PGO+TC working, we will see a considerable, possibly double-digit, improvement.
